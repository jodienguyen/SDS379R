## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#read in files
intakes <- read.csv("~/Desktop/SDS 379R/Austin_Animal_Center_Intakes.csv")
outcomes <- read.csv("~/Desktop/SDS 379R/Austin_Animal_Center_Outcomes.csv")

library(tidyverse)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
glimpse(intakes)
glimpse(outcomes)
```

**There are 166,308 observations in the intakes dataset and 166,262 observations in the outcomes dataset.
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
intakes |>
  mutate(Name = str_remove_all(Name, "\\*")) |> #remove astericks from names
  mutate(Date = as.Date(gsub(" .*$", "", DateTime), format = "%m/%d/%Y")) |>
  separate(Sex.upon.Intake, into = c("Intake.Fix", "Sex"), sep = " ") 


```
